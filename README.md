# The beginners guide to engineering and electronics
> My experience working with microcontroller and electronics development.

### Why ?
After some time I decided to back to writing articles on that topic with a lot of new knowledge and powers. You know the internet taught me everything I know and even more than just everything. The internet became not a hard gaining knowledge base. It is also an easy "fight" for me. I'm very thankful to everyone who helped me in gaining those knowledge from other useful articles, description to other technologies or devices, YouTube videos and reviews on my previous projects. All of those people are modern heroes and their help I grew up as a specialist, they helped me to build myself as I am for now. You know, I have only 9 grades diploma and never been to University and I do not regret that I chose the path of a free developer who does not have academic knowledge. Thanks to all who's building an Internet.
